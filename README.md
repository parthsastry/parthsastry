Hi, I'm Parth Sastry, a PhD student in the Engineering and Applied Sciences Department at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. As part of my undergraduate thesis project, I developed code for polarimetric analysis for the upcoming Daksha Space Telescope (https://www.dakshasat.in/science/grb-polarization). I'm currently interested in MHD simulations of compact object mergers.
