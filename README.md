Hi, I'm Parth Sastry, a PhD student in the Engineering and Applied Sciences Department at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. 

As part of my undergraduate thesis project, I developed code to analyse the polarimetric sensitivity of the upcoming Daksha Space Telescope (https://www.dakshasat.in/science/grb-polarization). You can find a couple publications related to this at https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16781 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12052 .

I'm currently interested in MHD simulations of compact object mergers. I'm working on testing out different AMR techniques for FLASH simulations of accretion tori.
